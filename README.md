# Scatter
"Scatter" AKA Scatter the Weak is a Powershell script to distribute and run SCAP Compliance Checker as well as remove artifacts from the remote host

### Idea  
- Further development could include removing log artifacts created on remote host
- Also porting to python and make the script work regardless of OS
