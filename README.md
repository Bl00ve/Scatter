# Scatter
"Scatter" AKA Scatter the Weak is a Powershell script to distribute and run SCAP Compliance Checker as well as remove artifacts from the remote host

## Note
There is quite a bit of setup to this in order to get the script running (such as creating a directory structure that's hard coded. 
I'll work on it more when I get the time, but the code is easy to read and troubleshoot.

### Idea  
- Further development could include removing log artifacts created on remote host
- Also porting to python and make the script work regardless of OS
